			<h2>Life tracking is more than counting steps</h2>
			<p>You track every detail of your life. How many steps you took today, what you ate, heart-rate, sleep patterns,
				the fluctuating temperature of your house, and more.
			</p>
			<p>What about the truly important things. Sure your health is important, but what did you DO? What made you happy? 
			What made you connect with somebody else? What made life worth living?
			</p>
			<p>How many people go through weeks and months doing the same thing again and again? Maybe that thing is interesting,
				but life is full of such wonderful diversity, how can we make sure we're fully engaged?

			<h2>Answering the simple question "This week I..."</h2>
			<p>This is what Bucket52 is all about. Every week, bucket52 asks you to complete the simple sentence "This week I...".
				Easy enough! But what happens when you try to answer that question every week? Do you start to notice a trend in 
				activities? Does it make you yearn to expand your horizons? Does it make you eager to get more involved, and 
				engage more with the world around you? What does your life look like when your focus shifts from living your
				everyday existence to challenging you to reach for your dreams? Is the world better off for it? What effect
				might it have on your friends and family as you involve them in your new found enlitemenment? What might it do
				for your community?
			</p>
			<p>Let's find the answer to these questions. Sign-in to bucket52 to get started, it's that simple.</p>
