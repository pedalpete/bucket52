		<h1>I made this!</h1>
		<h2>But I made it for you...</h2>
		<p>I'm Pete Field, I've been a software engineer for a while, and I came up with a much
			more complicated version of bucket52, with a more horrible name around 2007 or 2008.
			You can read more about the 
			<a href="https://blog.bucket52.com/origins-8cf85ac22458#.ccy55kr4p">origins</a> at the 
			<a href="https://blog.bucket52.com">bucket52 blog</a>
		</p>
		<p>The site is very much a work in progress. I have a full-time job with Data and CSIRO here in Sydney,
			Australia, as well as working on other programming projects.</p>
		<p>Of course, there is more to life than programming and work, and that is what this site is all about!</p>
		<p>Getting out there, getting it done, discovering new things</p>
		<p>I'd love to hear from you if you have suggestions, feedback, or questions. Just send me a note from the 
			<a href="/contact">contact page</a> and connect with bucket52 on <a href="http://twitter.com/bucket52app">twitter@bucket52app</a>
			or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bucket52/">facebook</a></p>
		<p>I'm definitely not precious about bucket52. I'm making it for you, and for all of us to live our best lives</p>
		<p>Thanks for being a part of bucket52</p>
		<p>Pete</p>
